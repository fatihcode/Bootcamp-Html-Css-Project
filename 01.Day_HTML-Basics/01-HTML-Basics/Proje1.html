        <p> Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
            There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
            And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
            Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
            Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
            Until one day, you walk.<br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
            Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
            This. is. learning.<br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it.<br>
            You just don’t get it, yet. Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
            Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You only have to know one thing:<br>
            You can learn anything.<br>
